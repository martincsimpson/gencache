Done:
    - Ruby API 
    - Cache configuration
    - Implementation of code blocks
        - Stale allowed
        - Smart Refresh
        - Data fetch
    - Cache Insert
    - Cache retrieval
    - Background refresh job

Questions for team:
    - Can we expose the blocks using procs, or is it better to use a class?
        Both: Lets use Class
    - Are we implementing cache mode now? - better to be internal or exposed as a block?
        Vincent: Agreed to not do it now
    - Do we use the wrapper, or do we set the generation and other IDs onto the object directly? 
        Both: Agreed to use metadata class

    - Connections to databases and perisstence 

Next Implementation Steps:
    - Package as a gem
    - In-memory storage driver
    - bucket_key: "merchant" (dynamic)
    - Working cache fetch/set using local_test.rb
    - Testing of background fetcher
    - Add logging
    - Cassandra backing store with migrations
    - Tests


Feedback from team:
    - end of this week local_test.rb working
    - packaging as a gem
    - in memory storage driver
    - bucket_key: "merchant",
