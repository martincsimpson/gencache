    - packaging as a gem
    - In-memory storage driver
    - Working cache fetch/set using local_test.rb.
    - Add logging

Questions for team:
    - Are we implementing cache mode now? - better to be internal or exposed as a block?
        Vincent: Agreed to not do it now
    - Connections to databases and perisstence 

Next Implementation Steps:
    - bucket_key: "merchant" (dynamic)
    - Testing of background fetcher
    - Cassandra backing store with migrations
    - Tests


Feedback from team:
